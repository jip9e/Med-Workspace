# Med-Workspace V3 Pro Max Plan

## Task 1: Pro-Grade UI/UX Foundations

- [x] Configure Tailwind theme with the new fonts.
- [x] Install 'lucide-react' and replace all emojis/primitive icons with professional SVG icons.
- [x] Follow TDD/frequent commit rules.

## Task 3: Bento Dashboard & OLED Theme
- [x] Create 'src/components/BentoGrid.tsx' to manage the dashboard layout.
- [x] Update 'App.tsx' to use the Bento layout:
  - Large tile for HoloAnatomy.
  - Vertical tile for NotesManager.

  - Small tile for Burnout Stats.
- [x] Implement OLED Dark Theme: Base background #000000, cards #0A0A0A, with subtle #1F2937 borders.
- [x] Follow TDD/frequent commit rules.

## Task 4: UI/UX Refinement & Accessibility
- [x] Add smooth transitions (transition-all duration-300) to all grid tiles, hover states, and UI indicators.
- [x] Implement a subtle 'glow' effect for the active medical model in HoloAnatomy.
- [x] Shift 'Medical Blue' accents to a softer, eye-friendly desaturated teal (#5DA5A5) to reduce blue-light strain.
- [x] Implement 'reduced motion' media query support for accessibility.
- [x] Final project audit: Ensure the V3 'Ultimate Cleanliness' goals are met across all modules.
- [x] Follow TDD/frequent commit rules.
